## About the documentation

The documentation is generated by [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) and [mkdocs-material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) using [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/C4G/BLIS/blob/master/.github/workflows/docs-deploy.yml). They use [markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) for composition.

## Making Local Changes

If you are using the devcontainer-based setup, you have everything you need. If you are running
locally, and you have Python installed, you should run:

```bash
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then you can run:

```bash
$ mkdocs serve
```

To see your documentation changes locally.

## Deployment

Deployment is handled by our [GitHub Action](https://github.com/C4G/BLIS/blob/master/.github/workflows/docs-deploy.yml), so once you make a pull request to the repository and it is merged, the documentation will be updated.
