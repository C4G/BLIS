# Project Webpage
This page has been created as part of Spring 2026's P3 assignment: Project Webpage.

## Project Description
The Basic Laboratory Information System (BLIS) is the flagship initiative of Computing for Good (C4G) at Georgia Tech, developed in partnership with the CDC and PEPFAR. For over 15 years, BLIS has served public health laboratories across sub-Saharan Africa, managing patient specimens and diagnostic data to combat infectious diseases. 

Our team is collaborating with the Ministry of Health and National Public Health Labs to modernize the platform. While the partner's goal is a transition to a cloud-based, bi-directional system, significant infrastructure challenges currently block progress.

Our mission this semester is to bridge this gap by upgrading the legacy PHP core, securing the system with local password recovery tools, and implementing a reliable self-update mechanism that functions even in resource-constrained environments. 

## Overall Project Goal
> TODO: Add description to each goal

These are our goals for the semester.

1. Testing and delivering BLIS PHP upgrade, including bug found during initial partner meeting.
2. Implementing a user facing password reset tool in the BLIS launcher.
3. Implementing a launcher based self-update feature.
