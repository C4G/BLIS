# Landing

Welcome to the C4G BLIS project!

You are looking at the documentation site for C4G BLIS. The website is generated
by the tool [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) from code in the
[C4G BLIS GitHub repository](https://github.com/C4G/BLIS).

## The Project

Here is the official brief:

> Open source system to track patients, specimens, and lab results. One of the original C4G projects,
> continuously in operation since 2010 and deployed in over a dozen countries, mostly in sub-Saharan Africa.
> 
> [http://blis.cc.gatech.edu](http://blis.cc.gatech.edu)
>
> Goals for Spring 2025 include:
>
> - Provide support for deploying BLIS online
> - Develop system for satellite labs to monitor their sample results at a 
>   higher-level lab avoiding physical delivery of results.

In concrete terms, this will mean at least a few things:

- Providing a regular time to meet with our stakeholders about deploying BLIS online
- Testing the BLIS online set up, documenting bugs, and fixing them
- Participating in updating BLIS documentation (this site!)
