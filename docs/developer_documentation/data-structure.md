# Database & Backup Structure

Notes as I look into the database and structure of the databases, and the backups generated by the "export" function.

## BLIS Default Users/passwords

|Username|Password|Description|
|-|-|-|
|cameroon_dir|dir123|Director's view|
|testlab1_admin|admin123|Lab admin account|
|testlab1_tech1|tech123|Lab tech account|
|testlab1_tech2|tech123|Lab tech account

## Database Dumps

In the BLIS download from the website, the MySQL tables are prepopulated with a structure. It's not clear if this can be recreated exactly from the various SQL files available in the data/ directory. So I dumped the databases using DBeaver and here they are:

* [blis_12](../assets/dump-blis_12-202202091919.sql)
* [blis_127](../assets/dump-blis_127-202202091919.sql)
* [blis_revamp](../assets/dump-blis_revamp-202202091919.sql)

I can use this to seed a container image of BLIS on Linux.
