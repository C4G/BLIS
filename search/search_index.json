It generates a report for a particular time period of the number of tests, specimens, or doctor statistics.</li> <li>Turnaround Time which opens the average test-wise turnaround times for the lab test reports, either for all or specific tests.</li> <li>Infection Report which opens an Infection Report for a specified laboratory. It generates reports of infections by patient age and gender.</li> <li>User Statistics which displays user specific statistics and user activity logs.</li> <li>Test Specific Reports which provides information on specific tests, and can be specified to an individual site.</li> </ol>"},{"location":"user_guide/30_manager_overview/#backup-data","title":"Backup Data","text":"<p>The Backup Data feature was created for two reasons - to revert to a previously backed-up copy in cases of system failure, but also to create a backup file of the current laboratory patient data for uploading to a BLIS on Cloud version.</p> <p>For example, one intended use of the second scenario would be to upload the current laboratory data to the director's instantiation of BLIS.
