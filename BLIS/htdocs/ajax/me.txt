INTRODUCTION  
  

XML-RPC is a remote procedure call protocol that uses XML to encode its calls and HTTP as a transport 
mechanism. 
It's remote procedure calling using HTTP as the transport and XML as the encoding. XML-RPC is designed 
to   be   as   simple   as   possible,   while   allowing   complex   data   structures   to   be   transmitted,   processed   and 
returned. 

PROBLEM SPACE  
  

As described in the CODA paper, there could arise a situation where we need to make parallel RPC calls to 
a set of workstations. For example, the server maintains a list of workstations (with a particular file cached). 
When   there's   a   update   on   this   file,   it   needs   to   communicate   this   update   remotely   to   all   the   workstations 
corresponding          to  that  file.   Using     XML-RPC         alone,     would     allow    making      sequential      RPC     calls   to   each 
workstation and wait for each response before making the next RPC. This has mainly two problems: 

I. TIMEOUTS: Doing it sequentially could lead to timeouts and the aggregate time to maintain consistency 
semantics increases greatly. 

II. TRANSPARENCY: This method also makes the handling of consistency semantics difficult to implement 
in a manner so as to make the RPC calls transparent to the workstation. For example, if the client wants a 
majority   semantics   where   majority   successful   RPC   responses   are   good   enough   to   declare   the   RPC   as   a 
success; this would be difficult by using XML-RPC alone for each server sequentially since the client would 
only   like   to   see   a   single   response   stating       if   the   RPC   was   a   success   or   a   failure.   The   client   could   be 
interested   only   in   the   semantics   and   not   in   the   individual   RPC   responses.   This   transparency   is   hard   to 
achieve without the concept of multiRPC using XML-RPC.

OUR SOLUTION ‐ multiRPC using XML‐RPC  
  

The   idea   of   multiRPC   using   XML-RPC   is   to   make   parallel   XML-RPC   requests   via   the   concept   of   multi- 
threading.   So,   each   thread   is   responsible   to   handle   the   RPC   to   a   particular   server.   These   threads   have 
multiple     points   of  execution     and   thus   these    XML-RPC        operations     proceed     in  parallel.  So,   the   above- 
mentioned problems are solved as follows: 

I. TIMEOUTS:   If   we   make   a   XML-RPC   to   a   dead   server,   even   in   this   case,   only   the   thread   assigned   to 
communicate remotely with that server blocks and finally times out. But this doesn't affect the operation of 
the    other   threads    running    concurrently.     For   example,      in  a  majority    semantics     case,    if  the  client  gets 
successful   responses   from   more   than   half   of   its   threads,   the   library   immediately   invokes   the   response 
handler/callback handler for the client. So, the client is free to proceed with its regular operation even if some 
thread times out on a response from a particular server. 

II. TRANSPARENCY: The client is only concerned in knowing whether the desired semantics succeeded or 
not. This is achieved by adding a level of indirection between the client and multiple servers. 

In the case of an asynchronous multiRPC, we achieve this level of indirection by creating a library response 
handler   function.   So,   each   response   from   the   asynchronous   call   to   a   server   would   return   to   our   library 
response   handler   rather   than   the   client's   callback   function.   This   way,   the   client's   callback   function   is   not 
invoked   for   a   response   from   each   server.   Instead,   it   is   the   library's   response   handler's   responsibility   to 
decide the success or failure of a semantic based on the responses received from each individual RPC and 
according inform the client's call back function just once. This maintains the transparency required. 

In   the   case   of   a   synchronous  multiRPC,   the   level   of   indirection   is   achieved   by   following   the   boss-worker 
model. The client thread acts as the boss. It delegates the responsibility of each RPC to its worker threads. 
The worker threads make the RPC calls. Depending on the responses received, they accordingly inform the 
boss/client thread through the usage of a global counter. On a successful RPC response, it increments this 
global counter. The client waits for this counter to reach the threshold value which would satisfy the required 
semantic. 

SYNCHRONIZATION MECHANISM  

  

Asynchronous multiRPC  
  
We have not use pthread mutexes for this mechanism because the pthreads just make the XML-RPC call 
and     then   join   the  boss    thread.    Given     that  a   pthread    mutex     requires    an    owner,    we    can't  use    this 
synchronization        facility.  Hence     synchronization        amongst      concurrent     threads     is  achieved      via   POSIX 
semaphores. 

The Code snippet is as follows:

sem_wait(&mutex_async);               //Critical Section for incrementing succesful RPC Response count 
response_count++;                     //Irrespective of success/failure, get the count; 
if(resultP)                           //Check if resultP is NOT NULL which means successful RPC response 
          global_count++; 
if(global_count == global_threshold)            //Semantic Requirement complete. 
                                                //Give the good news to the client's response handler ! 
          (*global_responseHandler)(serverUrl,methodName,paramArrayP,user_data,faultP,resultP);

We   have   used   pthread   mutexes   given   that   a   pthread   only   joins   after   receiving   the   response   to   the   XML- 
RPC. 
The Code snippet is as follows: 

pthread_mutex_lock(&mutex_semantic);                     //CRITICAL SECTION 
                                                         //clientCall_va is NOT THREAD SAFE. BETTER LOCK IT!! 
while(flag) 
          pthread_cond_wait(&cond_end,&mutex_semantic); 
flag=1; 
clientCall_va(&envP,         serverInfoP,     call_params->methodName,             call_params->format,        call_params->args, 
&resultP); 
xmlrpc_server_info_free(serverInfoP); 

if(!(envP.fault_occurred))            //Increment successful RPC response only 
                                      //if there's no fault in the RPC env var 
          global_threshold++; 
flag=0; 
pthread_mutex_unlock(&mutex_semantic); 
pthread_cond_signal(&cond_end);                          //END OF CRTICAL SECTION 

IMPLEMENTATION  
  

We have embedded the multiRPC facility in the existing library by modifying the following 2 files. 

     1.   xmlrpc_client_global.c  
     2.   xmlrpc_sample_add_client.c

We change the xmlrpc_client_call to accept a list of server URLs instead of a single URL. Further, we spawn 
server   URL   number   of   threads,   with   each   thread   responsible   for   a   single   RPC   i.e.   making   a   call   to   the 
primitive function 

 clientCall_va(&envP, serverInfoP, call_params->methodName, call_params->format, 
                    call_params->args, &resultP); 
 //where serverInfoP = xmlrpc_server_info_new(&envP, call_params->serverUrl); 

The Code snippet is as given below: 

routine_vars_sync *params_sync = 
(routine_vars_sync *)malloc(sizeof(routine_vars_sync) * url_count);//Create the Packaged Structure 

pthread_t *client=(pthread_t *)malloc(sizeof(pthread_t)*url_count);                     //Spawn threads equal to # of servers 

for(i=0;i<url_count;i++){ 
   if (!envP->fault_occurred) {                            //Start Packing stuff ! 
          strcpy(params_sync[i].methodName,methodName); 
          strcpy(params_sync[i].format,format); 
          params_sync[i].args = args; 
          strcpy(params_sync[i].serverUrl,serverUrl[i]); 
          params_sync[i].threshold = threshold; 

          pthread_create(&client[i],NULL,client_routine_sync,(void*)&params_sync[i]); 
          //Spawn a thread and let it take care of the entire RPC 
   } 

  } //end of for 

while(global_threshold<threshold)                //Hold fort until reqd # of responses come. 
                                                 //Once that's done, declare freedom!(Success) 
          fflush(stdout); 
va_end(args); 
return resultP; 
} 

Asynchronous multiRPC  
  
We change the xmlrpc_client_call_asynch to accept a list of server URLs instead of a single URL. Further, 
we spawn server URL number of threads, with each thread responsible for a single RPC i.e. making a call to 
the primitive function. The difference from the synchronous case is that the individual worker threads just 
make the asynchronous call and join. As mentioned earlier, we have introduced a level of indirection which 
act    as  a  callback    handler     for  the  spawned      threads    from    the  xml   library.   This   helps   in  achieving     the 
transparency since we are able to return a single result to the client's callback handler.

Code Snippet is as follows: 

if(response_count == servers_count && global_count < global_threshold) 
{ 
          (*global_responseHandler)(serverUrl,methodName,paramArrayP,user_data,faultP,NULL); 
} 

wherein global_responseHandler is the client's callback handler which is invoked only once. 

TEST CASES  
  

RESULTS for below given test cases are kept in the ‘Resultsʼ folder. 

The Test cases carried out are as follows: (Same for both synchronous and asynchronous) 

1. Anyone Semantic Success: We have sent requests to dead servers. Only 1 request is sent to the server 
that is alive. The result is a successful RPC complete response for client. 
(anyone_semantics_async_success.log) 

2. Anyone Semantic Failure: We have sent all requests to dead servers. In this case, the client's response 
handler gives a RPC failed message to the client. 
(anyone_semantics_async_unsuccess.log) 

3.   Majority   Semantic    Success:     We   have    sent  requests    to  some    alive  servers   and   dead   servers    such 
count(alive servers) > count(dead servers). The RPC returns a success message to the client. 
(majority_semantics_async_success.log) 

4.   Majority   Semantic     Failure:  We    have   sent   requests    to  some    alive  servers    and   dead   servers    such 
count(alive servers) < count(dead servers). The RPC returns a RPC failed message to the client. 
(majority_semantics_async_unsuccess.log) 

5. All Semantic Success: We send all requests to alive servers. The result is a success given to the client's 
response handler. 
(all_semantics_async_success.log) 

6. All Semantic Failure: We send 1 request to a dead server. Result is a failed RPC to the client. 
(all_semantics_async_unsuccess.log) 

NOTE: We have used the timeout facility of the xml-rpc library when a server crashes in between.
